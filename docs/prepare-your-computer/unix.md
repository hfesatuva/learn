# Mac/Unix/Linux

Linux is easy! 

- This is where we want everyone. 
- For this tutorial, it doesn't matter what distribution you have, because we will be using Docker.
- You may see some differences on a Mac, but Macs are Unix based, making them very similar to Linux.

## Linux

You can read about setting up "Docker Engine" [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). The instructions vary depending on the distribution you use. Note: Ubuntu is a "Debian-based" distro.

You will almost definitely want to also complete these [post-installation steps for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/).

## Mac

[These](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/) docs should help with getting "Docker Desktop" set up on Mac, whether you have a newer M1 Mac or an older Intel Mac. The M1 experience may be glitchy- as with any novel tech.

## Everyone

Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), a perfect app for editing code and running command prompt terminals.
